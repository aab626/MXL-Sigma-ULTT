<h2>MXL Sigma (Unofficial) Lag Test Tool</h2>

I made a small tool to know which GS is the least laggy for me to play, this test every GS avaliable at the moment and writes a report so you can choose the best for you.
<br>

Usage:
<ol>
  <li>Open the progam.</li>
<li>Enter how many tries per GS you want (more means more precise measuring) or leave blank to default (4).</li>
<li>Enter a Keyword or Country Code to filter the GS list.</li>
<li>The program will automatically test every GS, and when finished it will write a text report in the same folder.</li>
</ol>

<br>

Notes:
Only works on windows.
GS 6 Almost 100% of the time doesn't respond to pings.
With tries set to 1, the program will not be able to calculate a Standard Deviation (or average), so its not recommended for other than testing purposes.
