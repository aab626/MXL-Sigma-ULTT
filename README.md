MXL Sigma (Unofficial) Lag Test Tool\n
I made a small tool to know which GS is the least laggy for me to play, this test every GS avaliable at the moment and writes a report so you can choose the best for you.

Usage:
Open the progam.
Enter how many tries per GS you want (more means more precise measuring) or leave blank to default (4).
Enter a Keyword or Country Code to filter the GS list.
The program will automatically test every GS, and when finished it will write a text report in the same folder.

Notes:
Only works on windows.
GS 6 Almost 100% of the time doesn't respond to pings.
With tries set to 1, the program will not be able to calculate a Standard Deviation (or average), so its not recommended for other than testing purposes.

I'm open to suggestions and feedback, please post on topic, PM me or find me on Discord: Drizak#2555.
